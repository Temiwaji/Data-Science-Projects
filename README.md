1. [Amazon Business Reasearch Restaurant Case Study](https://github.com/Temiwaji/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Amazon%20Business%20Research%20Analyst%20Dataset.ipynb)

Food is an essential need for man's survival. Everyone of us at certain points has either had a best food or cravings for certain kinds of foods and would most likely go to any length to get it either by cooking or eating out. Some of the objectives we considered in thise project include; What food customers like the most? Does weather influence what people eat? What is the preferred mode of transportation used by the restaurant? What time do people pick their orders most? What is the correlation between days of the week with respect to the type of vehicle used to deliver food and the distance covered]?

This is a restaurant case study on amazon business research. Collaborated with 8 other young women on this group project. The notebook on this research has more details and answers the needed qustions. Also included is a presentation file.

2. [Supervised Machine Learning](https://github.com/Temiwaji/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/TSF%20Task%201.ipynb)

This is task 1 from The Sparks Foundation on prediction using supervised machine learning to predict the percentage of scores of a student based on the no. of hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables(i.e, hours and scores). Dataset used was obtained from http://bit.ly/w-data

Upon loading the dataset and plotting the distribution scores, it is observed that there is a positive linear relationship between the no. of hours studied and percentage scored. The prediction shows that the percentage score of a student who studies for 9.25 hours is 92.7%

3. Unsupervised Machine Learning
